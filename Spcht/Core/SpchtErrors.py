"""
I have read that its the pythonic way to introduce your own set of errors and exceptions to be more
specific about what has happened, i am a bit late to the party in that regard, only adding this many
months after i first started working on this projects, this makes the whole code unfortunatly to a
jumpled mess of standard exceptions and my own that i later created
"""
